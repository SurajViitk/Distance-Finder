##Overview

Distance_Finder is an app which gives distance between two points on the map one of which is fixed. We originally intended to keep one of the pointer as current location but failed to do so because of lack of time and skill in android development. When the app is opened, a red marker shows the fixed location and when we click at any other point (pointing with a pink marker), we first get the location details and then get the distance in a toast box.

##Development

Distance_Finder is a collaborative project of a group of three students Suraj Verma(surajv@iitk.ac.in), Anurag Pandey (pandeyrg@iitk.ac.in)and Prateek Gothwal(prtkgo@iitk.ac.in) of IIT Kanpur. We started this project on 11th March 2017 for Code.fun.do hackathon. We were unable to complete what we intended so we will keep developing this project.
